                <name>Psionics</name>
                <text>As a student of psionics, you can master and use psionic talents and disciplines. Psionics is a special form of magic use, distinct from spellcasting. </text>
                <text>     </text>
                <text>Psionic Talents: </text>
                <text>    A psionic talent is a minor psionic effect you have mastered. At 1st level, you know one psionic talent of your choice. You learn additional talents of your choice at higher levels. You learn an additional talent at 3rd, 10th, and 17th level. </text>
                <text>     </text>
                <text>Psionic Disciplines: </text>
                <text>    A psionic discipline is a rigid set of mental exercises that allows a mystic to manifest psionic power. A mystic masters only a few disciplines at a time. </text>
                <text>    At 1st level, you know one psionic discipline of your choice. You learn an additional discipline of your choice at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level.</text>
                <text>    In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice. </text>
                <text>     </text>
                <text>Psi Points: </text>
                <text>    You have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic disciplines you know. This energy is represented by psi points. Each psionic discipline describes effects you can create with it by spending a certain number of psi points. A psionic talent requires no psi points. </text>
                <text>    The number of psi points you have is based on your mystic level: 4 points at 1st level, 6 at 2nd, 14 at 3rd, 17 at 4th, 27 at 5th, 32 at 6th, 38 at 7th, 44 at 8th, 57 at 9th, 64 at 10th, and 71 at 18th.. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. Your psi point total returns to its maximum when you finish a long rest. The number of psi points you have can&#8217;t go below 0 or over your maximum. </text>
                <text>     </text>
                <text>Psi Limit: </text>
                <text>    Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend to activate a psionic discipline. The limit is based on your mystic level; at 1st level, your psi limit is 2, and it increases to 3 at 3rd, 5 at 5th, 6 at 7th, and 7 at 9th.  For example, as a 3rd-level mystic, you can spend no more than 3 psi points on a discipline each time you use it, no matter how many psi points you have. </text>
                <text>     </text>
                <text>Psychic Focus: </text>
                <text>    You can focus psionic energy on one of your psionic disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it. As a bonus action, you can choose one of your psionic disciplines and gain its psychic focus benefit, which is detailed in that discipline&#8217;s description. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit. </text>
                <text>    You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn&#8217;t limit your ability to use other disciplines. </text>
                <text>     </text>
                <text>Psionic Ability: </text>
                <text>    Intelligence is your psionic ability for your psionic disciplines. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic discipline or when making an attack roll with one. </text>
                <text>     </text>
                <text>Discipline save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier </text>
                <text>     </text>
                <text>Discipline attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>

Known as Avatars, these mystics vary from tyrants to inspiring leaders who are loved by their followers.</text>
                <text>    Avatars can bring out extreme emotions in the people around them. For their allies, they can lend hope, ferocity, and courage, transforming a fighting band into a deadly, unified force. For their enemies, they bring fear, disgust, and trepidation that can make even the most hardened veteran act like a shaky rookie.</text>

                <text>Starting at 3rd level, you can focus your mind to read the psionic imprint left on an object. If you hold an object and concentrate on it for 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a psionic discipline), you learn a few basic facts about it. You gain a mental image from the object&#8217;s point of view, showing the last creature to hold the object within the past 24 hours.</text>
                <text>    You also learn of any events that have occurred within 20 feet of the object within the past hour. The events you perceive unfold from the object&#8217;s perspective. You see and hear such events as if you were there, but can&#8217;t use other senses.</text>
                <text>    Additionally, you can embed an intangible psionic sensor within the object. For the next 24 hours, you can use an action to learn the object&#8217;s location relative to you (its distance and direction) and to look at the object&#8217;s surroundings from its point of view as if you were there. This perception lasts until the start of your next turn.</text>

        <text>You place a mote of pure fury within a creature&#8217;s mind, causing its bloodlust to overcome its senses and for it to act as you wish it to. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Psychic Focus: While you are focused on this discipline, any enemy within 5 feet of you that makes a melee attack roll against creatures other than you does so with disadvantage. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Primal Fury: (1&#8211;7 psi) As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage per psi point spent on this ability and immediately use its reaction to move its speed in a straight line toward its nearest enemy. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Fighting Words: (2 psi; conc., 10 min.) If you spend 1 minute conversing with a creature, you can attempt to leave a simmering violence in its mind. At the end of the minute, you can use an action to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw to resist feeling violent urges against one creature you describe to it or name. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed. On a failed save, the target attacks the chosen creature if it sees that creature before your concentration ends, using weapons or spells against a creature it was already hostile toward or unarmed strikes against an ally or a creature it was neutral toward. Once the fight starts, it continues to attack for 5 rounds before this effect ends. This effect immediately ends if the target or any ally it can see is attacked or takes damage from any creature other than the one it has been incited against. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected and has no inkling of your attempt to bend its will. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Mindless Courage: (2 psi) You cause a creature's bloodlust to overcome its sense of preservation. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or, until the end of your next turn, it can&#8217;t willingly move unless its movement brings it closer to its nearest enemy that it can see. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Punishing Fury: (5 psi; conc., 1 min.) You cause a creature's rage to grow so hot that it attacks without heeding its own safety. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or, until your concentration ends, any creature within 5 feet of it can use a reaction to make a melee attack against it whenever the target makes a melee attack. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed.</text>

        <text>    If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a creature's roar, a musical instrument, or any other sound you pick. It lasts for 1 minute.</text>

On a failed save, the target takes 1d10 fire damage per psi point spent, and it catches on fire, taking 1d6 fire damage at the end of each of its turns until your concentration ends or until it or a creature adjacent to it extinguishes the flames with an action.

        <text>Psychic Focus: While focused on this discipline, you have advantage on Strength checks. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Push: (1&#8211;7 psi) As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d8 force damage per psi point spent and is pushed up to 5 feet per point spent in a straight line away from you. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Move: (2&#8211;7 psi) Choose one object you can see within 60 feet of you that isn&#8217;t being worn or carried by another creature and that isn&#8217;t secured in place. It can&#8217;t be larger than 20 feet on a side, and its maximum weight depends on the psi points spent on this ability, as shown below. </text>
        <text>    As an action, you move the object up to 60 feet, and you must keep the object within sight during this movement. If the object ends this movement in the air, it falls. If the object would fall on a creature, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take damage as listed on the table below. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Psi &#8212; Weight &#8212; Damage </text>

        <text>     </text>
        <text>Inertial Armor: (2 psi) As an action, you sheathe yourself in an intangible field of magical force. For 8 hours, your base AC is 14 + your Dexterity modifier, and you gain resistance to force damage. This effect ends if you are wearing or don armor. </text>

        <text>Telekinetic Barrier: (3 psi; conc., 10 min.) As an action, you create a transparent wall of telekinetic energy, at least one portion of which must be within 60 feet of you.

        <text>     </text>
        <text>Grasp: (3 psi; conc., 1 min.) You attempt to grasp a creature in telekinetic energy and hold it captive. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be grappled by you until your concentration ends or until the target leaves your reach, which is 60 feet for this grapple. </text>
        <text>    The grappled target can escape by succeeding on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your psionic ability plus your proficiency bonus. When a target attempts to escape in this way, you can spend psi points to boost your check, abiding by your psi limit. You gain a +1 bonus per psi point spent. </text>
        <text>    While a target is grappled in this manner, you create one of the following effects as an action: </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Crush: (1&#8211;7 psi) The target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per psi point spent. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Move: (1&#8211;7 psi) You move the target up to 5 feet per psi point spent. You can move it in the air and hold it there. It falls if the grapple ends.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>Grappled:</text>
        <text>&#8226; A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>&#8226; The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>&#8226; The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.</text>

        <text>     </text>
        <text>Ice Sheet: (2 psi) As an action, choose a point on the ground you can see within 60 feet of you. The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point becomes covered in ice for 10 minutes. It is difficult terrain, and any creature that moves more than 10 feet on it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. If the surface is sloped, a creature that falls prone in the area immediately slides to the bottom of the slope. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Frozen Sanctuary: (3 psi) As a bonus action, you sheathe yourself with icy resilience. You gain 20 temporary hit points. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Frozen Rain: (5 psi; conc., 1 min.) As an action, choose a point you can see within 120 feet of you. The air in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point becomes deathly cold and saturated with moisture. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 6d6 cold damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until your concentration ends. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage. </text>
        <text>    As an action, a target that has its speed reduced can end the effect early if it succeeds on a Strength (Athletics) check with a DC equal to this effect&#8217;s save DC. </text>
        <text>    You can increase this effect&#8217;s damage by 1d6 per each additional psi point spent on it. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Ice Barrier: (6 psi; conc., 10 min.) As an action, you create a wall of ice, at least one portion of which must be within 60 feet of you. The wall is 60 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 12 and 30 hit points. A creature that damages the wall with a melee attack takes cold damage equal to the damage the creature dealt to the wall.</text>
        <text>    </text>
        <text>Prone:</text>

        <text>     </text>
        <text>Darkness: (1&#8211;7 psi) As an action, you create an area of magical darkness, which foils darkvision. Choose a spot you can see within 60 feet of you. Magical darkness radiates from that point in a sphere with a 10-foot radius per psi point spent on this ability. The light produced by spells of 2nd level or less is suppressed in this area. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Light: (2 psi; conc., 1 min.) As an action, an object you touch radiates light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light lasts until your concentration ends. Alternatively, a creature you touch radiates light in the same manner if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. While lit in this manner, it can&#8217;t hide, and attack rolls against it gain advantage. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Shadow Beasts: (3 psi; conc., 1 min.) As an action, you cause two shadows to appear in unoccupied spaces you can see within 60 feet of you.

        <text>Radiant Beam: (5 psi; conc., 1 min.) As an action, you project a beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6d6 radiant damage and is blinded until your concentration ends. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. A blinded target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. </text>
        <text>    You can increase this effect&#8217;s damage by 1d6 per each additional psi point spent on it.</text>

        <text>Psychic Focus: While focused on this discipline, you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Desiccate: (1&#8211;7 psi) As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 1d10 necrotic damage per psi point spent on this ability, or half as much damage on a successful one. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Watery Grasp: (2 psi) As an action, you unleash a wave that surges forth and then retreats to you like the rising tide. You create a wave in a 20-foot-by-20-foot square. At least some portion of the square&#8217;s border must be within 5 feet of you. Any creature in that square must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is pulled up to 10 feet closer to you. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage. You can increase this ability&#8217;s damage by 1d6 per additional psi point spent on it. </text>

The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes trapped in the sphere of water until your concentration ends. While the target is trapped, its speed is halved, it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls, and it can&#8217;t see anything more than 10 feet away from it. However, attack rolls against it also suffer disadvantage. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful one. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Animate Water: (7 psi; conc., 1 hr.) As an action, you cause a water elemental to appear in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you.

        <text>Psychic Focus: While focused on this discipline, you have resistance to lightning and thunder damage. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Cloud Steps: (1&#8211;7 psi; conc., 10 min.) As an action, you conjure forth clouds to create a solid, translucent staircase that lasts until your concentration ends. The stairs form a spiral that fills a 10-foot-by-10-foot area and reaches upward 20 feet per psi point spent. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Hungry Lightning: (1&#8211;7 psi) As an action, you lash out at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you with tendrils of lightning. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, with disadvantage if it&#8217;s wearing heavy armor. The target takes 1d8 lightning damage per psi point spent on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Wall of Clouds: (2 psi; conc., 10 min.) As an action, you create a wall of clouds, at least one portion of which must be within 60 feet of you.

        <text>     </text>
        <text>Whirlwind: (2 psi) As an action, choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Winds howl in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in the sphere must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage and be moved to an unoccupied space of your choice in the sphere. Any loose object in the sphere is moved to an unoccupied space of your choice within it if the object weighs no more than 100 pounds. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Lightning Leap: (5 psi) As an action, you let loose a line of lightning that is 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You can then teleport to an unoccupied space touched by the line. </text>
        <text>    You can increase this ability&#8217;s damage by 1d6 per additional psi point spent on it.</text>

        <text>Wall of Thunder: (6 psi; conc., 10 min.) As an action, you create a wall of thunder, at least one portion of which must be within 60 feet of you. The wall is 60 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Every foot moved through the wall costs 1 extra foot of movement. When a creature moves into the wall&#8217;s space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or it takes 6d6 thunder damage, is pushed in a straight line up to 30 feet away from the wall, and is knocked prone. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Thunder Clap: (7 psi) As an action, choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Thunder energy erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 8d6 thunder damage, and it is stunned until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.</text>

        <text>Animate Weapon: (1&#8211;7 psi) As an action, your mind seizes control of a one-handed melee weapon you&#8217;re holding. The weapon flies toward one creature you can see within 30 feet of you and makes a one-handed melee weapon attack against it, using your discipline attack modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

The wall is 60 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Each 5-foot wide section of the wall has AC 12 and 100 hit points.

        <text>Animate Earth: (7 psi; conc., 1 hr.) As an action, you cause an earth elemental to appear in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The elemental lasts until your concentration ends, and it obeys your verbal commands. In combat, roll for its initiative, and choose its behavior during its turns. When this effect ends, the elemental disappears. See the Monster Manual for its stat block.</text>

The benefit lasts for 1 hour, no concentration required. </text>
        <text>     </text>
        <text>Find Creature: (2 psi; conc., 1 hr.) You cast your mind about for information about a specific creature. If you concentrate for this option&#8217;s full duration, you then gain a general understanding of the creature&#8217;s current location. You learn the region, city, town, village, or district where it is, pinpointing an area between 1 and 3 miles on a side (DM&#8217;s choice). If the creature is on another plane of existence, you instead learn which plane. </text>

        <text>Wandering Eye: (6 psi; conc., 1 hr.) As an action, you create a psychic sensor within 60 feet of you. The sensor lasts until your concentration ends. The sensor is invisible and hovers in the air. You mentally receive visual information from it, which has normal vision and darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The sensor can look in all directions. As an action, you can move the sensor up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can&#8217;t enter another plane of existence.

        <text>Phasing Eye: (7 psi; conc., 1 hr.) As Wandering Eye above, except the eye can move through solid objects but can&#8217;t end its movement in one. If it does so, the effect immediately ends.</text>
